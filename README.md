This is a "kata" project done to expirement with the purest possible use of javascript (besides express)

This projetc is NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, thre's no password encryption, no decent validation, no project patterns

# What learned with this project
- Basic "auth" (middleware, browser storage)
- dealing with DOM, creating "preset" elemnts by items in an array (like done in frameworks)
